## Day 1
###thoughts:
- Flow is good for when you’re doing something you already know. Flow is not good for when you are learning—remember for code retreat!
- how much of the code you work on is greenfield and how much is editing existing code? You cannot refactor without tests, you cannot do OO without refactoring. Code is often written once and read many many times
- Martin Fowler- refactoring is altering existing code without altering its behavior. Oftentimes we say refactor but we mean rewriting
- programmers sometime equate terseness with cleverness and we want so badly to be clever. quit picking on everyone for being extremely clear
- distraction is what kills you
- you can make it easier to tell how things are different by making them more alike
- if there is a non-recursive solution, you should use it

###methods:
- the inebriation test- you’re on call, they call you about a bug in some code you did not write. You need to be able to look at code immediately and understand what it does
- If you solve the easy problems first, you will find that the hard problems become easier.
- Practicing by making each test pass one by one, we practice as if we’re writing the test ourselves
- practicing not changing the sending and receiver at once replicates working in large code bases where you cannot do this.

###terms:
- shameless green
- cumulative song
- Open/Close (from solid)

###questions:
- when you dry methods out right away, you can get this inside-out pattern***ask about this
- don’t chase red, ask for explanation

###google:
 - cumulative songs and java


###ruby:
- can pass ranges to ‘when’ method in case statements
